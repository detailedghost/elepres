<h1>This is all cool, but why should I care?</h1>
<p>With the world being so connected, it's almost become necessary to know some form.</p>
<p>Here's a small list of jobs that need some foundational knowledge:</p>
<ul class='fun-list'>
  <li>Scientist</li>
  <li>Engineers</li>
  <li>Cyber Security</li>
  <li>Online Bankers</li>
  <li>Stock-Brokers</li>
  <li>Accountants</li>
</ul>
<p>Even traditionally technology free jobs are becoming more dependent like architecture and medicine!</p>
